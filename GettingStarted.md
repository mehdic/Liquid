# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

These directions assume you're running on a Windows environment, such as a Windows PC or using an emulator on another operating system.
If you don't have access to a Windows environment, you can use LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© on a Windows virtual machine.
See the [Using LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© on Microsoft Azure](AzureGuide.md) page for directions.

### Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition is free for individuals and for academic use.
It is available at https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx.

While Visual Studio is not required to run the LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© samples, it is necessary if you want to write your own algorithms or run scripts.

Installation steps:

1. Make sure you select F# as one of the programming languages to install (everything else is optional).
2. After the installation, follow the steps below to download LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© into c:\Liquid
3. Open the "solution file" at: C:\Liquid\source\Liquid.sln
4. After you choose your preferences (a few clicks) you'll see the "Solution Explorer" window on the right side. The Liquid project will show up as "unavailable". This is because F# is actually installed on demand. Right click on the project and one of the options will be to install F#.
5. After F# installs you're done.

### .NET 4.6

The .NET Framework 4.6 or later is required.
Installing Visual Studio 2015 will install .NET 4.6.

If you are only running the samples and aren't installing Visual Studio, you can install .NET 4.6 from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130 if it isn't already installed.

## Downloading LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü©

We recommend placing the download into a folder named c:\Liquid.
If you choose a different folder, you will need to create a c:\Liquid folder and copy LiquidTikZ.tex from your LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© folder into c:\Liquid.
The samples and directions below assume that you have installed into the c:\Liquid directory.

There are three ways to download LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü©:

* Click on the button on the main project page to the right labeled **Download ZIP**. This will download LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© and its supporting files to your system in a file named Liquid-master.zip, which you may then extract to a folder on your system. If you extract into C:\  you will now have a root folder named Liquid-master. Rename the folder to C:\Liquid and you're done.
* If you have a GitHub command-line client installed, you may instead change directory to the c:\Liquid directory and use the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/msr-quarc/Liquid
```
* If you have the GitHub desktop application installed, you may click on the button on the main project page to the right labeled **Clone in Desktop**.

The first time you run LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü©, you may get a security warning telling you that the program was downloaded from another system and may not be safe.
Once you grant LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© permission to run by clicking the appropriate button, the warning should not recur.

## Accepting the License

You have to accept the license terms the first time you run LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© on a new environment.

To do so, open a command window and enter the following commands:
```
c:
cd \Liquid\bin
Liquid.exe
```
You should see:
```
0:0000.0/===================================================================================================
0:0000.0/=    The Language-Integrated Quantum Operations (LIQUi|>) Simulator                               =
0:0000.0/=    is made available under license by Microsoft Corporation                                     =
0:0000.0/=    License terms may be viewed at https://github.com/msr-quarc/Liquid/blob/master/LICENSE.md    =
0:0000.0/=    Please type Y, followed by return, to indicate your acceptance of these terms                =
0:0000.0/===================================================================================================
```
If you type Y (or y) and then return, you will see:
```
0:0000.0/Thank you for accepting the license terms
```
LIQUi||> will then exit. After this, you should not be asked to accept the license again on that environment.

## Registration (Optional)

While LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© is free, we do request that you register so that we can track how many people are using it.
To do this you will need to submit a registration request email to our LISTSERV, which will reply with a registration command.
If you don't register, your copy of LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© will run, but will print a nag message at the top of every run.

The LISTSERV is at LISTSERV@lists.research.microsoft.com.
The email body for your registration should contain:
```
/REG
```
You will receive a reply email that will contain a command you can copy and paste into a command window to register your copy of LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü©.
The response will look something like:
```
> /REG
Liquid.exe /reg test@microsoft.com`2015-10-06T00:00:00`O6K7yUcYnKdjfis2I05vXA== 1
```
The command to execute is the line starting with "Liquid.exe".
Make sure you're in the c:\Liquid\bin directory before entering this command.

Registering your copy of LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© does not subscribe you to the liquid-news email list.
If you wish, you can do both at the same time by sending a single email with both commands in the body:
```
SUB Liquid-news FirstName LastName
/REG
```
To subscribe anonymously and register your copy of LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© at the same time, you can send a single email with both these commands in the body:
```
SUB Liquid-news anonymous
/REG
```

## Running LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü©

LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© is a command-line program, so you need to open a command window to use it.
Once you have a command window open, enter the following commands:
```
c:
cd \Liquid\bin
Liquid.exe
```
You should see the following:

## BLAS (optional)

If you want to use the quantum random walk sample or compute state vector entanglement entropies,
you will need a BLAS library.

**If you don't use these functions, then LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© will work fine with no BLAS implementation available.
THe BLAS library is dynamically loaded before use, and is not required for LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© to operate.**

We have tested with OpenBLAS, which is available from http://www.openblas.net/.

OpenBLAS requires two additional DLLs, libgfortran-3.dll and libquadmath-0.dll.
These are most easily obtained as part of the MinGW-w64 package, available at http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php.
You will need to build the FORTRAN compiler to create these DLLs.

There are some helpful hints at http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/index.html and at http://www.r-bloggers.com/an-openblas-based-rblas-for-windows-64-step-by-step/.

LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© looks for a library named "libopenblas.dll" in either the same directory as the LIQùëàùëñ|‚ü© executable,
or in a directory on your PATH, or in the C:\Liquid\bin directory (if it exists).
If you are using OpenBLAS, the other two libraries should be placed in the same directory as libopenblas.dll.

If you are using a different BLAS implementation, you will need to rename the DLL to libopenblas.dll and place it,
along with any required supporting DLLs, into one of the valid directories.
