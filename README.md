## What Is LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩?

LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ is a simulation platform developed by the [Quantum Architectures and Computation](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/quarc/) team at Microsoft Research to aid in the exploration of quantum computation. 
LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ stands for “Language Integrated Quantum Operations”.  
A quantum operation is usually referred to as a unitary operator (U) applied to a column state vector (also known as a ket: |> ).
The “i” is just a constant scaling factor, hence the acronym.

LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ includes three simulators: 
* A full state vector simulator that tracks the detailed evolution of the quantum state
* A stabilizer simulator based on CHP (Aaronson and Gottesman, http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196)
* A highly-optimized full state vector simulator for fermionic Hamiltonians

LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ is available under a [Microsoft Research license](LICENSE.md).

## What Can I Do With It?

You can use LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ to define quantum circuits, render them into a variety of graphical formats, and execute them
using an appropriate simulator.

Some of the specific algorithms you can simulate with LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ are:
* Simple quantum teleportation
* Shor's factoring algorithm
* Quantum chemistry: computing the ground state energy of a molecule
* Quantum error correction
* Quantum associative memory (Ventura and Martinez, http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9807053)
* Quantum linear algebra (Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171)

All of these algorithms, and many more, are included as samples with LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩.

## How Do I Get It?

You can download the LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ executable, libraries, sample scripts, and documentation from this site.

See the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) page for directions on how to download, register, and start using LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩.

If you don't have access to a Windows environment, you can use LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ on a Windows virtual machine.
See the [Using LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ on Microsoft Azure](AzureGuide.md) page for directions.

## How Do I Use It?

See the [users' guide](https://msr-quarc.github.io/Liquid/LIQUiD.pdf) and the [full help documentation](https://msr-quarc.github.io/Liquid/).
The help may also be downloaded as a [single file](https://msr-quarc.github.io/Liquid/Liquid.chm), if desired. There is also a [tutorial video](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=258279) available that will take you through the basics.

Note that this version of LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ is limited to a maximum of 23 physical qubits for full state vector simulation.

If you run into a problem or have a question, you can [post an issue](https://github.com/msr-quarc/Liquid/issues).
If you have other feedback, you can contact the LIQ𝑈𝑖|⟩ team at liquid@microsoft.com.
